Sorting Technique 
    bubble sort - sort the element comparing each element to next and swap for the smaller, takes more time not much effective.
    selection sort - the swaping task is done only when the smallest element is found and remaing array is used leaving the sorted part.
    insertion sort - array is divided into two part sorted and unsorted , first element of array is taken as sorted and then compare the next part when smaller than that is found. it is inserted at its approriate place in the sorted array.
